# Wireshark Analysis and IOC Investigation

This repository provides a structured walkthrough of a Wireshark analysis tutorial, focusing on identifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and investigating malicious network activity. It documents key steps for network forensics and traffic analysis.

## Objectives

1. Learn how to use Wireshark effectively for network analysis.
2. Identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) in network traffic.
3. Extract key information such as IP addresses, MAC addresses, hostnames, and downloaded files.
4. Analyze traffic using filters and understand protocol hierarchies.
5. Integrate findings with tools like VirusTotal for additional insights.

## Key Features

- **Understanding Wireshark's Interface**: Navigate the protocol hierarchy and customize the interface by adding relevant columns.
- **Using Filters**: Apply filters to focus on specific types of network traffic.
- **IOC Investigation**: Identify infected files, find hash values, and analyze their origins.
- **Device Information Retrieval**: Extract IP addresses, MAC addresses, and hostnames of affected machines.
- **Practical Exercises**: Reinforce learning with additional exercises from [Malware Traffic Analysis](https://malware-traffic-analysis.net).
